<p id="id1" class="ltx_p">We investigate the dynamic response of flexible aircraft in low-altitude atmospheric turbulence. To this end, three turbulence models of increasing fidelity, namely, the one-dimensional von Kármán model, the two-dimensional Kaimal model and full three-dimensional wind fields extracted from large-eddy simulations (LES) are used to simulate ambient turbulence near the ground. Load calculations and flight trajectory predictions are conducted for a flexible high-aspect ratio aircraft, using a fully coupled nonlinear flight dynamics/aeroelastic model, when it operates in background atmospheric turbulence generated by the aforementioned models. Comparison of load envelopes and spectral content, on vehicles of varying flexibility, shows strong dependency between the selected turbulence model and aircraft aeroelastic response (e.g. 58% difference in the predicted magnitude of the wing root bending moment between LES and von Kármán models). This is mainly due to the presence of large flow structures at low altitudes that have comparable dimensions to the vehicle, and which despite the relatively small wind speeds within the Earth boundary layer, result in overall high load events. Results show that one-dimensional models that do not capture those effects provide fairly non-conservative load estimates and are unsuitable for very flexible airframe design.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Atmospheric turbulence and its effects on aircraft flight has been a major concern of the aerospace sciences for more than a century <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Hunsaker and Wilson, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1917</a>)</cite>. The efforts to characterise the impact of atmospheric turbulence on aircraft loads can be traced back to the early development and consolidation of discrete gust and continuous turbulence models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Jones, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">1940</a>; Miles, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">1956</a>; Zbrozek, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">1965</a>; Eichenbaum, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">1971</a>; Houbolt, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">1973</a>)</cite>. Today, airworthiness certification procedures (e.g. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">European Aviation Safety Agency (<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2007</a>)</cite>) have adapted guidelines and methodologies derived from both that early research and the accumulated experience of decades of in-service flight data. However, the very recent development of high-altitude pseudo satellites (HAPS) for an increasingly wide range of applications in remote sensing and communications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Tozer and Grace, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2001</a>; Yang and Mohammed, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2010</a>)</cite> is challenging the conventional understanding of the interactions between (nonlinear) aeroelasticity and atmospheric turbulence. The extreme operational demands and requirements of HAPS have resulted in more slender and much lighter platforms which inevitably renders them more flexible. This is true for example for stratospheric solar high-aspect ratio aircraft (NASA Helios, Boeing Oddyseus, Facebook Aquila, Airbus Zephyr, etc.) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Gonzalo et al., <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2018</a>)</cite>. Poor understanding of the low-altitude response of such very flexible aircraft (VFA) has previously led to poorly controlled flight dynamics and even vehicle loss <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Noll et al., <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2004</a>)</cite>. Gaining physical insight into the aeroelastic interactions while quantifying the uncertainty of flight dynamics is considered key in further developing these technologies.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">VFA aeroelasticity is characterised by large (geometrically-nonlinear) structural displacements and by strong interactions between the low-frequency structural modes and the vehicle flight dynamics. Conventional aircraft, on the other hand, present a certain degree of decoupling between the structure and the flight dynamics modes. Consequently, while aeroelastic analysis methods in the latter case are based on linearised frequency-domain solvers with potentially some higher-order corrections, the linear assumption brings limitations that can result in poor estimates in the response of VFA <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Cesnik et al., <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>)</cite>. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Afonso et al. (<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite> provide a comprehensive survey on the state of the art of VFA aeroelasticity with focus on commercial aviation. Indeed, while the current HAPS configurations are already relatively flexible and feature low-frequency structural modes, they are likely to be even more flexible as technology matures. </p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Continuous turbulence design criteria are often based on the von Kármán spectrum with few empirical observations. Employing such approach to study atmospheric turbulence interacting with very flexible aircraft aeroelasticity poses two major issues. First, the von Kármán spectrum is derived from isotropic turbulence arguments, a condition which is rarely met in atmospheric turbulence, and never at low altitudes. In the lower part of the planetary boundary layer (surface layer), turbulence is strongly modulated by the presence of an aerodynamically rough surface and heat flux due to solar radiation. These effects combined together can significantly alter the flow dynamics and therefore deviate from the isotropic turbulence case implied by the von Kármán-like turbulence that is usually found in higher altitudes (e.g. CAT). The low-altitude operating environment of a generic VFA is shown schematically in figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Assessment of low-altitude atmospheric turbulence models for aircraft aeroelasticity" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The near-surface turbulence coherent structures (e.g. high/low-speed streaks) will dominate the flight dynamics of such vehicle. The second shortcoming relates to the coupling between these large-scale turbulence structures (e.g. eddies) with the dynamics of very flexible aircraft. As high-wing deformations are expected under normal trim conditions, aircraft are prone to dynamic instabilities of significant magnitude <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Afonso et al., <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>; Noll et al., <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2004</a>)</cite>. In particular, high-aspect ratio wings are expected to present a coupling between rigid-body and elastic motions since the frequency of the elastic modes are closer to those of the flight dynamics modes. This strong coupling has been well-documented in, e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Schmidt (<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2012</a>)</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Van Schoor and Von Flotow (<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">1990</a>)</cite> for general aircraft aeroelasticity and, more specifically for high-aspect ratio aircraft, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Patil et al. (<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2001</a>)</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Tang and Dowell (<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2004</a>)</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Raghavan and Patil (<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2009</a>)</cite>, and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Stanford and Beran (<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">2013</a>)</cite>, among others. To this day, a limited number of experimental studies on high-aspect ratio wings exists. They have shown however, that very flexible wings have a significantly different gust response characteristics under different deformations and load conditions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Liu et al., <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite>. Inherently, additional analysis is required in order to gain insight into the complex interactions between wind gusts and aircraft aeroelasticity. This particular study focuses on investigating the effect of low-altitude turbulence on very flexible high-aspect ratio aircraft by first conducting a sensitivity analysis of atmospheric turbulence generation methods including the industry-standard von Kármán model as well as demonstrating the differences in the dynamic aeroelastic response between very flexible and stiff aircraft.</p>

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Within the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL), turbulence evolves in response to the local topography as well as the heating and cooling of the Earth’s surface. The latter, categorises the ABL in three distinct states, namely, a neutral boundary layer (NBL), a convective boundary layer (CBL) and a stable boundary layer (SBL). In the neutral boundary layer, thermal effects remain unimportant and air parcels move adiabatically solely due to Coriolis forcing and surface friction. Thermal effects on the other hand are significant in the convective and stable boundary layers in which temperature stratification leads to a capping inversion (inversion layer). In the CBL, capping inversion acts as a lid and turbulence convection is dominated by large plumes (thermals) that transport and mix air away from the surface. The CBL state is often found following the sunrise. On the other hand, the SBL is characterised by a strong temperature stratification which typically leads to a shallower boundary layer thickness, strong wind shear and much smaller and weaker eddies than the neutral and convective cases <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Wyngaard (<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2010</a>)</cite>. Nonetheless, all three states (except for the convective case) are very rarely in a state of equilibrium and transition from one to another takes place multiple times during the day. However, provided the disparity between the ABL state evolution (<math id="S2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\sim" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.p1.1.m1.1a"><mo id="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">∼</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.p1.1.m1.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1">similar-to</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.p1.1.m1.1c">\sim</annotation><annotation encoding="application/x-llamapun" id="S2.p1.1.m1.1d">RELOP:similar-to</annotation></semantics></math> hours) and the time spent by a VFA in the lower ABL (<math id="S2.p1.1.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\sim" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.p1.1.m2.1a"><mo id="S2.p1.1.m2.1.1" xref="S2.p1.1.m2.1.1.cmml">∼</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.p1.1.m2.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S2.p1.1.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.p1.1.m2.1.1">similar-to</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.p1.1.m2.1c">\sim</annotation><annotation encoding="application/x-llamapun" id="S2.p1.1.m2.1d">RELOP:similar-to</annotation></semantics></math> minutes), the assumption of ABL equilibrium can be considered a valid assumption.</p>

<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In simulating atmospheric turbulence, two approaches can be generally considered. The first approach uses stochastic formulations to generate wind fields based on first and second-order statistics (spectral/co-spectra). Stochastic generation of wind fields has been an active area of research over the last decades <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Veers, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">1988</a>; Mann, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">1994</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">1998</a>; Muñoz-Esparza et al., <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite>. For applications in wind engineering <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Jeong et al., <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>; García et al., <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>, the most common stochastic model is that of Kaimal <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Kaimal et al., <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">1972</a>; Veers, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">1988</a>)</cite>. The second technique on the other hand, utilises detailed numerical simulations to resolve the fluid flow equations (or a parametrisation of them) for a given temporal and spatial scale. Such a popular method is large-eddy simulation (LES). The idea underpinning LES lies in resolving the large energetic structures of the flow while modelling the smaller scales. LES produces three-dimensional wind field for a given computational domain and its quality depends on the resolution and modelling parameters. LES can be therefore considered as a high-fidelity model, as it resolves all relevant turbulent scales. Further details on both approaches are discussed next.</p>

It is worth noting that in equation (<a href="#S2.E4" title="(4) ‣ 2.2 High-fidelity turbulent flows via large-eddy simulation ‣ 2 Atmospheric turbulence modelling ‣ Assessment of low-altitude atmospheric turbulence models for aircraft aeroelasticity" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>) the viscous term of the Navier-Stokes equation has been neglected. This is due to the high-Reynolds number and the fact that the mesh is coarse enough so that the near-ground viscous layer will not have any impact on the calculations. Another implication of being under-resolved in the near-ground surface is that applying a no-slip boundary condition is devoid of any meaning. Instead, we simulate the bulk effect of velocity shear by replacing it with slip velocity and imposing a local shear stress through a wall-stress model. Commonly, the wall-stress model of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Moeng (<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">1984</a>)</cite> is used by considering the Monin-Obukhov similarity (MOS) theory and in this study we employ the recent formulations of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Bou-Zeid et al.

To model the wake of the aircraft, a background-flow-convected wake model is used. In this way, we do not account for the mutual interactions between the free (shed) vortex rings, which significantly reduces the computational cost during each iteration <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Del Carre and Palacios, <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">2019</a>)</cite>. Instead, the wake is allowed to convect by the ambient flow and interact with the structure without exhibiting the near tip roll-up. Studies conducted by the authors have determined that an ambient flow-convected wake yields near identical results when compared to the free-force wake for the problems of interest, while the savings in computational cost are remarkable. The present mid-fidelity aeroelastic solver deals with the coupled behaviour of the structural/aerodynamic effects of flexible structures and it has been implemented within the framework <span id="S4.p3.3.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">SHARPy</span>, written in python, with low level libraries in C++ and Fortran, and parallelisation using OpenMP. </p>

This poses a bottleneck which may be approached in two ways. A direct solution is to read and store in RAM only the two necessary snapshots. This is suitable for distributed computers, where permanent storage latency is high, and nodes can be devoted to a small number of simulations each. However, shared memory computers usually have a lower permanent storage latency and the RAM available per processor node is lower. The solution is then to map the binary file stored in the relatively fast hard drive into an array-like structure, so data is directly read from the permanent storage. This solution was seen to drastically reduce the memory overhead with a 20% increase of the interpolation time cost. The 3D velocity field reader implemented here supports both methods, and it implements a cache where data fields are read only once during each simulation. In the end, the decision of which method is used for the 3D field read is a combination of the architecture the software is being run in, the number of cases running simultaneously and the time between LES snapshots. Once the 3D field is mapped or copied into an array, a multivariable interpolation is conducted. First, the volumetric data is given as a structured regular grid. This makes trilinear interpolation a suitable solution, while the quicker closest neighbour interpolation is also available for finer 3D field discretisations. Results presented here are obtained using a trilinear interpolation in space. The time-dependency of the 3D velocity fields is considered in this analysis. When multiple snapshots of the field are given, a linear interpolation is performed between the two closest snapshots to the simulation time. A visualisation of the combined 3D velocity fields and aircraft mode is shown in figure <a href="#S4.F6" title="Figure 6 ‣ 4.1 3D velocity fields as aeroelastic inputs ‣ 4 Nonlinear time-domain aeroelastic solver ‣ Assessment of low-altitude atmospheric turbulence models for aircraft aeroelasticity" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6</span></a> below.</p>

Perfect spanwise coherence in the background flow implies generation of net lift resultant that results in substantial inertia relief and an overall gain of altitude.
The transverse component of the trajectory exhibits larger deviations between the three turbulence-generation models as well as within LES itself when the aircraft is initially placed at different

Interactions with the large scale flow features in the LES-generated turbulence results in significant variation of the aircraft trajectory, which can deviate both right and left while in some cases it may experience a full U-turn and continue flying in the opposite direction.

In turn, the non-uniform velocity distribution gives rise to asymmetric loads which through the aircrafts flexibility lead to a gradual veer to the right, which leads to a vehicle U-turn. It should be noted that the aircraft altitude does not change significantly during the U-turn trajectory and that ensemble averaged lift distributions reduced further this variability. This is a result of a passive control mechanism inherent to the aircraft by its design which makes the aircraft navigate through turbulence without having full control over its trajectory. This of course can be addressed by a flight control system which can alter the aircraft trim and thus have an impact on loads as well. As far as the root loads are concerned, similar variability is observed for all three atmospheric turbulence inputs.

This effect can be attributed to the lack of streamwise coherence of the Kaimal model as well as the assumption of “frozen turbulence” which generates non-physical longitudinal structures once the 2D planes are projected to a three-dimensional wind field. Once the aircraft is misaligned from the mean flow, it is incident to a non-uniform velocity field with large velocity differences across its wing span, increasing thus the torsion experienced by the root. Similar fluctuations can also be observed for the “severe” case and the LES inputs. This however is not an artefact of the LES method but rather the effect of the near-surface large coherent flow structures.</p>

The shape of the load envelopes is also consistent in all three turbulence intensity cases. In the case of the OOP plotted against torsion, the load envelopes are stretched along the OOP direction signifying the significant increase of OOP with increasing levels of turbulence. Similarly, the shape of the IP versus torsion envelopes appears to be elongated with the larger in-plane moments occurring at negative root torsion.
Nonetheless, in both cases (OOP and IP) the choice of the turbulence input model appears to be more significant. The LES data provide by far the largest load envelope with its boundaries twice as big as those of Kaimal. On the other hand, the Kaimal model yields smaller load envelopes with the difference between the two models being increased with the magnitude of turbulence intensity. Surprisingly, the smallest load envelopes are formed by the von Kármán model input. This is true for both the IP and OOP moments. We argue that this difference is due to the fact that in the von Kármán model, the spanwise coherence is by definition equal to unity, leading to a uniform spanwise load distribution. As a result, the dynamic loads give rise to a lifting of the overall structure through “inertial relief” (applied work by gust forces is transformed into rigid body kinetic energy). This is confirmed by figure <a href="#S5.F8" title="Figure 8 ‣ 5.2 Flexible aircraft dynamics for each atmospheric turbulence model ‣ 5 Numerical results ‣ Assessment of low-altitude atmospheric turbulence models for aircraft aeroelasticity" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a> in all three turbulence intensity cases by the vertical trajectory of the von Kármán model.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p9.1" class="ltx_p">Comparing the OOP moment distribution with the other two models as well as with that of the incident velocity for the von Kármán model we may not be able to infer the origin of such a large difference. However, following our earlier argument we may again justify such a large difference in the PDF occurs by the stronger inertia relief in this case.

As in the load envelopes, torsion fluctuations of the stiff case are an order-of-magnitude) smaller than those of the flexible one with the differences being more pronounced in the low-frequency region. This is a well-known steady aeroelastic effect that cascades in – lift twists the wing thus reducing the bending moments and increases torsion. Conversely, the OOP PSD shows a significant increase in the energy over the mid-range frequencies (inertial subrange). Finally smaller difference can be observed for the IP moment with the stiff case exhibiting smaller fluctuations. This transfer of energy from torsion and IP moment fluctuations to OOP signifies the fundamental differences in the turbulence/loads transfer function between the flexible and the stiff aircraft. The former, transforms the OOP loads into torsion which in turn changes its aerodynamic behaviour and therefore the resultant root loads. This can be seen as a passive load alleviation mechanism which targets a reduction of the OOP moment. The stiff aircraft on the other hand, by experiencing a certain degree of decoupling between structural and flight dynamics, remains more responsive to incident turbulence (the <math id="S5.SS3.p3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="-5/3" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS3.p3.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S5.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.5" xref="S5.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.5.cmml"><mo id="S5.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml">-</mo><mrow id="S5.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.5.1" xref="S5.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.5.1.cmml"><mn id="S5.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.2" xref="S5.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.2.cmml">5</mn><mo id="S5.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.3" xref="S5.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.3.cmml">/</mo><mn id="S5.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.4" xref="S5.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.4.cmml">3</mn></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS3.p3.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S5.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.5.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.5"><minus id="S5.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.1"></minus><apply id="S5.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.5.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.5.1"><divide id="S5.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.3"></divide><cn type="integer" id="S5.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.2">5</cn><cn type="integer" id="S5.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.4.cmml" xref="S5.SS3.p3.1.m1.1.4">3</cn></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS3.p3.1.m1.1c">-5/3</annotation><annotation encoding="application/x-llamapun" id="S5.SS3.p3.1.m1.1d">ADDOP:minus NUMBER:5 MULOP:divide NUMBER:3</annotation></semantics></math> scaling is maintained in the inertial sub-range) implying it may experience larger fatigue loads during its operation.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the present study we have conducted aircraft aeroelasticity simulations using turbulence input fields which are assumed to be representative of their operating environment. The aeroelastic coupling and dynamic loading on a very flexible aircraft was found to be highly modulated by the coherent structures and flow features of low-altitude atmospheric turbulence. This may be of critical importance for some very light air vehicles currently under consideration.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The choice of the turbulence generation method was found to have a significant impact on both loads and flight dynamics of the aircraft. LES and Kaimal models provide similar results with LES being able to predict larger load envelopes. Kaimal was found to be problematic when it is used within our moving frame of reference as the application of the frozen turbulence hypothesis used to transform temporal 2D planes into spatial full three-dimensional wind fields does not generate three-dimensional coherence in the wind field. As a result, small deviations of the aircraft from the dominant wind direction generated sudden “load jumps” which affected the load envelopes in our simulations. LES, on the other hand, simulates a more realistic turbulent environment with large scales extending in the streamwise direction and generating flow coherence. The von Kármán model was the worst performing method of those considered, particularly when used in a moving three-dimensional frame of reference. The uniform planar velocity fields from this approach result in spanwise loading which substnunderpredicts the magnitude of the loads and overpredicts the energy transferred into rigid body motion. Therefore its use for loads and aeroelastics at low altitudes is not advised.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The comparison between the flexible and the stiff cases has demonstrated the extent of aeroelastic effects in the previous simulations. Analysis of the two aircraft flight dynamics shows that stiffer aircraft are prone to instabilities from high-frequency perturbations (gusts) leading to large OOP moment loads. More flexible vehicles, on the other hand, have natural load alleviation mechanisms through structural (elastic) and rigid body motion coupling. Results have shown smaller OOP loads as the energy contained in gust loading is distributed between rigid body motion, torsion, OOP and IP moments. Overall, as the flight dynamics of high-aspect ratio flexible aircraft were found to be fundamentally different from that of the stiff one, more emphasis should be given to non-linear aeroelastic phenomena which might occur under turbulent conditions and are currently not well-captured by existing computational models. </p>
